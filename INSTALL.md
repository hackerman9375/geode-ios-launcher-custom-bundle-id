# Installation Guide
> [!WARNING]
> For this installation guide, it is **required** to have a computer with Administrator access, as this guide will require installing software on your computer to sideload Geode, and to obtain a pairing file for **JIT**. Additionally, **JIT** is a **__requirement__** if you want to run Geode without jailbreaking.

> [!WARNING]
> Do **not** use enterprise certificates in sideloaders **like ESign and Scarlet.** Those certificates **do not have the entitlements for enabling JIT** (`get-task-allow`). You **won't be able to enable JIT** if you use them. If you want to use ESign, buy a developer certificate.

## Prerequisites
- iOS/iPadOS 14.0 or later
- PC (Windows, Linux) or Mac OS
- Apple ID (Secondary / Throwaway Recommended)
- USB Cable to connect your device (Lightning / USB C)

## Installing SideStore / AltStore
> [!TIP]
> **SideStore** is recommended to use over **AltStore**, because a PC is **not required** after the initial install.
> You can skip this step if you are using Sideloadly or TrollStore, but you may still need to follow the first step, especially if you have never sideloaded an app before.

1. **Enabling Developer Mode (iOS 16+)**
	- If you are on iOS 16 or later, you will need to enable **Developer Mode** in order to launch third party apps like SideStore, otherwise you will encounter this error when attempting to sideload SideStore or any app:
	- ![](screenshots/install-1.png)
	- To enable **Developer Mode** on your iOS device, navigate to `Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Developer Mode`. Do note that this will require restarting your device.
	- ![](https://faq.altstore.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2606795771-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FAfe8qEztjcTjsjjaMBY2%252Fuploads%252FWSvXhUTj8UZyGd1ex652%252FFcejvMRXgAE8k3R.jpg%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D5e380cd0-be4e-406a-914b-8fa0519e1196&width=768&dpr=2&quality=100&sign=8860eb96&sv=2)
	- After your device restarts, you will be prompted to "Turn on Developer Mode", press "Turn On", and **Developer Mode** should be enabled!

2. **Installing SideStore** (Recommended)
	- Follow the steps provided here: https://sidestore.io/#get-started
	- SideStore is recommended if you do not want to refresh your apps while keeping your PC on.

3. **Installing AltStore**
	- If you plan on installing SideStore, skip this step. Otherwise follow these steps depending on what computer you have:
    - Download and install [AltServer](https://altstore.io/), or [AltServer-Linux](https://github.com/NyaMisty/AltServer-Linux) for Linux.
	- [Windows Guide](https://faq.altstore.io/altstore-classic/how-to-install-altstore-windows)
	- [Mac OS Guide](https://faq.altstore.io/altstore-classic/how-to-install-altstore-macos)

Now you can proceed with installing Geode! If you are not jailbroken, **install the IPA**. If you're jailbroken and plan to stay so, **install the TIPA** version.

## Installing Geode through SideStore / AltStore
> [!NOTE]
> You will need to **refresh** both the store and Geode every week, otherwise you will not be able to run the app.

Navigate to the **My Apps** tab, and tap the `+` button to add an app. Select the IPA for the Geode app, and the Geode app should appear on your home screen!

![](screenshots/install-altstore.png)

## Installing Geode through TrollStore
Tap the `+` button and tap either **Install IPA File** or **Install From URL**, depending if you manually downloaded the TIPA file. After either selecting the TIPA file for the Geode app, or providing the URL, the Geode app should appear on your home screen!

![](screenshots/install-trollstore.png)

## Post Installation (IPA / Non-Jailbroken)
> [!TIP]
> You can skip this step if you installed the .tipa version of Geode, and are jailbroken. Simply follow the steps in the setup process in the app.

After going through the setup process, you may have seen the warning that **Just-In-Time** (JIT) compilation is required. This is true if you want to run Geode without being jailbroken, as by default, Apple restricts how apps can manage memory.

> [!WARNING]
> JIT also requires you to have **Wi-Fi** enabled on your iOS device. Cellular and/or Airplane Mode will **not work**.

There are a few ways to launch Geode with JIT, depending on both iOS version, and your use case.

### For iOS 16.6.1 and Below
> [!NOTE]
> This method requires **AltStore** or **SideStore**. If you sideloaded this app with Sideloadly, this method __will not work__.

Ensure that AltServer is running before proceeding. Also if you are on iOS 16.6.1 or Below, it is recommended to install **TrollStore** instead here: https://ios.cfw.guide/installing-trollstore

#### Option 1: AltStore (AltJIT)
1. Enable the **Manual reopen with JIT** setting in the Geode app if you are using AltStore.
2. Tap the **Launch** button in the Geode app.
3. Exit the Geode app.
4. Open AltStore.
5. Navigate to the **My Apps** tab.
6. Long-press the **Geode** app, 
7. Press "Enable JIT"
8. Geode should launch in Geometry Dash!

#### Option 2: SideStore
1. Tap the **Launch** button in the Geode app.
2. Geode should launch in Geometry Dash!

### For iOS 17.4+ and Later
#### StikJIT (Recommended)
> [!NOTE]
> For the first time setup, you will need a computer to get a Pairing File. If you installed SideStore, you likely already have a pairing profile, meaning there is no need to reinstall Jitterbug Pair.

#### Steps for downloading Jitterbug Pair (Skippable if you already have a Pairing File)
1. Go to [Jitterbug Pair](https://github.com/osy/Jitterbug/releases) and download the version for your computer.
2. Run the program with your iOS device connected to your computer. It will save a file to your computer.
3. Use iCloud, Airdrop, or a website such as [Pairdrop](https://pairdrop.net/) to upload the pairing file to your iOS device.

#### Downloading StosVPN
1. Download StosVPN from the App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stosvpn/id6744003051 (or Test flight: https://testflight.apple.com/join/hBUbg4ZJ.
2. Launch the app and click on Connect
3. It'll ask you to add "StosVPN" as a VPN Configuration. Click "Allow" and enter your passcode to add it.
4. Go back to StosVPN and click on "Connect", this is what should appear on the screen. If it does, you can continue with this guide by installing StikJIT.

![](screenshots/stosvpn.png)

> [!TIP]
> StosVPN allows StikJit and SideStore to work without Wi-Fi connection, just by Airplane Mode. Unfortunately, this on-device VPN does not support cellular. However, as later will be mentioned in StikJIT, you can use cellular data after launching an app with JIT.

#### Downloading StikJIT
1. Download the latest IPA of StikJIT here: https://github.com/0-Blu/StikJIT/releases
2. Sideload the IPA by using the same method as you did installing Geode.
3. (If you haven't already) Download StosVPN.
4. Click "Connect" in StosVPN (This is needed every time you want to activate JIT with StikJIT to launch with Geode)
5. Launch the StikJIT app (and upload the Pairing File you've received from Jitterbug Pair if you haven't done that already).
6. Open the Geode app.
7. Tap the **Launch** button in the Geode app.
8. Geode should launch in Geometry Dash!

> [!TIP]
> StikJIT doesn't require a Wi-Fi to be connected to the network to launch with JIT as it happens on-device, but it does require Wi-Fi connection. This is due to Apple limitations, but can be bypassed by downloading StosVPN! You can still use your cellular data after enabling an app with JIT by turning cellular data off, turning on Wi-Fi, launching Geode, turning cellular data back on.

#### JITStreamer
> [!NOTE]
> For the first time setup, you will need a computer to get a Pairing File. After the setup, you will never need a computer for SideStore or JIT. If you installed SideStore, you likely already have a pairing profile, meaning there is no need to reinstall Jitterbug Pair. Additionally, this method is only if you do not want to use StikJIT, as unlike JITStreamer, StikJIT doesn't require an internet connection, as it is on-device JIT.

[JITStreamer](https://github.com/jkcoxson/JitStreamer-EB) works for iOS 18+, and overall is the recommended method to launching Geode with JIT, as it does not require a computer each time you want to run Geometry Dash.

#### Option 1: Auto JIT
> [!NOTE]
> This method is no longer supported in favor of StikJIT, and due to many others misunderstanding it's purpose.
1. Follow https://jkcoxson.com/jitstreamer (For Jitterbug Pair, install the `.zip` corresponding to your operating system.)
2. It is recommended to follow the guide on an iOS device, as you will need to upload the pairing file to get the wireguard config.
3. After installing the shortcut, launch the **Geode** app again.
4. Enable the **Enable Auto JIT** setting in the Geode app.
5. Set the **Address** to be `http://[fd00::]:9172` if it isn't already set to that.
6. Enable the `jitstreamer` VPN in the WireGuard app
7. Tap the **Launch** button in the Geode app.
8. Geode should launch in Geometry Dash!

#### Option 2: Manual Method
1. Enable the **Manual reopen with JIT** setting in the Geode app.
2. Follow https://jkcoxson.com/jitstreamer (For Jitterbug Pair, install the `.zip` corresponding to your operating system.)
3. It is recommended to follow the guide on an iOS device, as you will need to upload the pairing file to get the wireguard config.
4. After installing the shortcut, launch the **Geode** app again.
5. Tap the **Launch** button in the Geode app.
6. Exit the Geode app. (https://support.apple.com/en-us/109359 if you don't know how to exit an app)
7. Open the **JitStreamer EB** Shortcut
8. Tap **Geode** when the shortcut asks "Which one?"
9. Geode should launch in Geometry Dash!

> Optionally, you can follow the youtube tutorial here for installing both SideStore and JITStreamer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mt4cwFyPsoM

## Conclusion
You should now be able to run Geometry Dash with Geode! You can install mods by tapping the **Geode** button on the bottom of the menu, and browse for mods to install!
